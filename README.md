# Flappy Bird AI with NEAT

This is a Python-based clone of the classic **Flappy Bird** game, enhanced with an AI agent trained using the **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** algorithm. The AI learns to play the game by evolving its neural network through generations, without any pre-labeled data or supervised training.

## Features

- 🎮 Flappy Bird mechanics using `pygame`
- 🧬 NEAT algorithm for AI evolution (`neat-python`)
- 🧠 AI learns to play by trial and error (reward / punishment)
- 🌆 Procedurally generated pipes with randomized locations
- 📈 Real-time score tracking and generation updates
- 🔁 Restart and replay options with keyboard input
