# Flappy-Bird-NEAT
Flappy Bird AI with NEAT This project is a Flappy Bird clone in Python using pygame, enhanced with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to train an AI to play the game autonomously. It demonstrates procedural level generation, physics-based gameplay, and real-time neural network learning without relying on labeled training data.
